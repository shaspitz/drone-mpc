# Model Predictive Control For Urban UAV Transportation
Using Model Predictive Control (MPC), this project simulates an autonomous passenger sized quadcopter flying in 3-D space between Berkeley, San Francisco, and Palo Alto. Specifically, the UAV aims to travel between destinations at a constant velocity while minimizing input power for a predefined trajectory. Furthermore, the UAV is constrained to fly within a virtual tube, limiting the UAVâ€™s displacement from the reference trajectory.
